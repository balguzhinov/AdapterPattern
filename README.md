# AdapterPattern

In this assignment we have implemented Adapter Pattern. I have implemented Taxi example for this pattern.
First of all, i have created Taxi interface which has 2 methods such as drive and fill. After that i have created 2 classes such as Astana Taxi and Yandex taxi which have also 2 methods such as filling and driving. Each of them have own values. Then i had to implement adapter class which extends one of the Taxi's classes and implements to Taxi interface.
